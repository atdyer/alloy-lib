/**
Scope Notes:

As in Matrix, CSR values are indexed using integers, so
matrix size is limited by the bitwidth in the same way.
However, in CSR matrices, the IA sequence must be exactly
rows+1 values long. Therefore, the maximum number of rows
is limited by the maximum sequence length. By default,
Alloy uses bitwidth=4 and maxseq=4, meaning that the max
number of rows is 3. For a bitwidth of 4, the maximum
possible seq size is 7, allowing up to 6 rows. Be sure
to set the seq length (and int) to an appropriate value.
  Values and column indices are stored in a sequence as
well, and so the maximum total number of nonzero values
a CSR matrix can hold is equal to the maximum seq size,
as is the maximum number of columns.

The following is a table showing the Int ranges for
a given bitwidth:

int: [min, max]
  4: [-8, 7]
  5: [-16, 15]
  6: [-32, 31]
  7: [-64, 63]
